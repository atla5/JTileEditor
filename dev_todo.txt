general/refactor:
  - write code for calculating the (r,c) values in each PixelObject
    to make accessing much easier
  - refactor ColorChanger and ButtonPanel buttons to return focus
    to the pixels themselves and not the ColorChonger object
  - modify/create side panel to hold all of the tools/buttons, previews,
    and overall color history.
  - refactor ColorChanger back into separate classes using Observers

New functions/effects:
  - graft over some of the ButtonPanel code into new code.
  - block addition: right click to add a polygon. set inner 
                    pixels to that color.
	-find shortest path between two pixels.
	-store all pixels inside of selection area in a list
	-for pixel in list: pixel.setForeground(#{current color});
  - increase resolution: duplicate resolution
        -break each pixel into 4 separate pixels based on quadrant
	-set all those pixels to the color of the parent
	-construct new pixelGrid with new dimensions.
  - decrease resolution: half resolution
	-take the average of each relevant value of each relevant 4-pixel
	 group. 
	-contstruct the new pixelgrid and set each to the  color created 
	 by said average

new classes/features:
  x create a grid of pixel objects as with previous build but 
    not just canvases.
  - create a new class 'Listener' to handle all of the actionListeners
    for key commands and click events per pixel. 
    	 -in a separate package containing all the other functions. (?)
